Project management:

1. I would also rename 'backend' dir to 'proj'.
2. Add lint/formatter to dev deps: `uv add --dev ruff`
3. Before you commit new code run: `uv run ruff format` 

Implementation:

- [x] Create new models
- [ ] Create serializers with rest-framework
- [ ] Create views
- [ ] Plug views to URLs

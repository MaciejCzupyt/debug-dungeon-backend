Project management:

Implementation:

- [x] Create new models
- [x] Create serializers with rest-framework
- [x] Create views
- [x] Plug views to URLs
- [ ] Add screenshots from the index view and projects details view in readme
- [ ] Create a view for user management - creating accounts, without the ability to list other users
- [x] Fix ability to create user without password
- [ ] Update serializers/models to include the owner username in the JSON instead of user id
- [ ] Make sure that only the owner can delete their resources (probably add validation in a view)

- [ ] Set timestamp to "now" on save always
- [ ] Update resource owners on save too
